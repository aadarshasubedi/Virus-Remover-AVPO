Virus Remover AVPO
==================

AVPO.EXE is a file recently detected by several antivirus databases and appears to be dropped by a rootkit installer, most likely the Win32/Pacex virus or the Win32/PSW.Agent.NDP trojan. This file is yet to be determined globally as Good or Bad, therefore it is currently classified as Unknown, though it does appear to be hostile. This application has been created to remove the threat by removing various registry entries, processes and files from an infected system in attempt to clean out this threat.
